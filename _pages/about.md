Hi! I am an incoming Computer Science PhD student at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), advised by Prof. [Peter G. Jacobs](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/peter-g-jacobs) and Prof. [Lizhong Chen](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~chenliz/). My research interests lie in **artificial intelligence**, **machine learning**, **high-performance computing**, and **large language models**.

Prior to joining OSU, I earned my master's degree at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where I was advised by Prof. [Wooyoung Kim](https://faculty.washington.edu/kimw6/). During my time there, I focused on applying large language models in bioinformatics and developed genomic data analysis frameworks.

I completed my bachelor's degree at [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://hcmut.edu.vn/en), where I worked under the supervision of Prof. [Tho Quan](https://www.cse.hcmut.edu.vn/qttho). My undergraduate research involved building a hand gesture recognition system for post-stroke rehabilitation.
